# Letter-value plots
Letter-value plots to eliminate anomalies or outlier pixel values ​​in digital remote sensing images. Outliers often appear in quite complex mathematical operations, such as exponentials, logarithms, square roots, and so on. Outlier values ​​have the potential to change the visual quality of the image, and of course will have a direct impact on the statistical analysis of the image. You can use that file Cleaning_pixel_outliers.ipynb as an example of the implementation.
